# CSS-Cascade
This repository is a collection of CSS Cascade exercises. At first, I struggled to wrap my head around the concept, so I continuously practiced by creating variations and revisiting the material. Through repetition and hands-on experimentation, I eventually got the hang of it and gained a solid understanding of how the CSS cascade works.
